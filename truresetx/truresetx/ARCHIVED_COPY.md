# ARCHIVED: duplicate project folder

This nested `truresetx/` folder appears to be a duplicate project copy (IDE or export). It has been left in-place to avoid accidental data loss. Treat this folder as archived and do not edit main project files here.

If you'd like, I can move it into `archive/` or remove it after you confirm.
